part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

The reason is that if we would train our model on the entire text the model will learn how to generate text's instead of words or chars, this will cause a generalization error and fix the model to specific text.
When we split the text we can make a more "creative" model that will learn the writing style instead of memorizing texts.
